# Challenge 1: No ifs no buts(Toy Problem)
This function takes in two numbers, 'a' and 'b' and uses a 'case' statement with the spaceship ('<=>') operator to determine whether 'a' is smaller than, bigger than, or equal to 'b'.
The spaceship operator returns '-1' if 'a' is less than b, 0 if they are equal, and 1 if a is greater than b. The case statement then matches the result of the comparison to the appropriate string.
# Challenge 2:Ordered Count of Characters(Toy Problem)
This function uses a hash to keep track of the count of each character in the string. It then maps the hash to an array of key-value pairs and sorts them by the index of the first occurrence of each character in the original string. Finally, it returns the list of arrays.
